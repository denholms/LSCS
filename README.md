# LSCS
2015 SENG 422 project.

1.0 You need to explain through one of the subsystems how your implementation is consistent with your architecture design for 
    that subystem and how it satisfies the system requirement. Particular emphasis should be placed on the 5 topmost quality
    attribute requirements considered in Part 1.
    
2.0 It is expected that you can explain how appropriately the communication (synchronous and asynchronous) and data flows
    between components have bee implemented.
    
3.0 In the case you miss any of the project requirements, you must be able to explain the reason why and how it could affect
    the system performance.
    
4.0 If your implementation does not match your architecture design you must provide a rationale for that and state what 
    modifications in your design are needed to match your implementation.
    
5.0 You must use as much as possible all available COTS components and avoid re-implementing any ready-made component.
